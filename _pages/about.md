Welcome! I am a final year PhD candidate in Finance of [University *of* Otago](https://www.otago.ac.nz/), and I am currently in the final stages of completing my dissertation. I earned my master in Business in Finance from [University *of* Otago](https://www.otago.ac.nz/).  

As a researcher, my interests lie in risk management, asset pricing, and in particular understanding the behavior of financial markets and the impact of policy decisions on these markets. During my time as a master and Ph.D. student, I have gained valuable experience in conducting empirical research, analyzing financial data, and presenting my findings in conferences and academic journals. My academic work has been [published](research) in *Economics Letters*, *International Review of Finance*, and *Journal of Futures Markets*. 

In addition to my research, I have also been actively involved in teaching and mentoring undergraduate students in finance. I believe that effective teaching is not just about imparting knowledge but also about inspiring students to think critically and independently. I was the [lecturer](teaching) and [instructor](teaching) of FINC204: Personal Finance and I assisted in [teaching](teaching) FINC102: Business Mathematics, BSNS114: Financial Decision Making, and FINC204: Personal Finance. I have been the [meeting manager](service) of the Derivatives and Quantitative Finance Group (DQFG) meetings. 

I am also voluntering as the [treasurer](service) of the Midwinter Carnival in Dunedin. 

As I approach graduation, I am excited about the next phase of my career. I hope to continue conducting research and contributing to the academic community while also exploring opportunities to work in industry and collaborate with other professionals.
